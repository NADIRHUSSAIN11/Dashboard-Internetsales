# Internetsales ETL Using SSIS, SSAS & Dashboard

In this project, I created a dashboard using the Adventure Works sample data warehouse. Adventure Works is a fictitious company that sells bicycles and bicycle accessories. The data warehouse contains information about the company's sales, customers, products, and employees.

The main steps I followed in this project are:

- Step 1: I stored the data warehouse in an MS SQL server by using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services). SSIS is a tool that allows me to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a data warehouse.
- Step 2: I made multidimensional and tabular cubes using SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services). SSAS is a tool that allows me to create and manage data models that provide fast and accurate analysis of data. A multidimensional cube is a data structure that organizes data into dimensions and measures, while a tabular cube is a data structure that organizes data into tables and columns.
- Step 3: I accessed the cubes in Power BI and made an attractive dashboard. Power BI is a tool that allows me to create interactive reports and visualizations of data. The dashboard shows the key performance indicators (KPIs) of Adventure Works, such as sales amount, sales quantity, gross margin, customer count, and product count. The dashboard also allows me to filter and slice the data by different dimensions, such as date, product category, customer segment, and sales territory.

This project was a learning experience for me to work with data warehouses and cubes using Microsoft tools. I gained valuable skills in data integration, data modeling, and data visualization. I also learned how to use Power BI to create a dashboard that can answer business questions and provide insights.
